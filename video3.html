                    <strong>INFLUENCER PROMOTING PRODUCTS | 网红种草</strong>
                    <br/>Many people now like to follow the recommendations of influencers to go to certain restaurants or buy products. However, with the increasing number of these influencers, some of them have gradually become professionalized. There is a phenomenon of influencers collaborating with businesses to create false advertising, which harms consumers' confidence in consumption.

                    <br/>Mooncakes are a popular gift for the Mid-Autumn Festival. In the past, major brands have used elaborate and exquisite packaging to attract consumers. However, excessive packaging has led to waste and raised the price of mooncakes. Since 2022, new regulations have been implemented to simplify packaging materials and control prices, prompting businesses to refocus on the mooncakes themselves.

                    <br/>Just like traditional cigarettes, long-term use of electronic cigarettes can lead to nicotine addiction. E-cigarettes may even contain toxic substances that are not found in traditional cigarettes. China's National Tobacco Administration has issued new regulations that limit the production and sale of e-cigarette cartridges with flavors other than traditional tobacco flavors (such as fruit flavors, candy flavors, and mint flavors), in order to reduce the addiction of young people who seek novelty but lack self-control.

They should also strengthen supervision and guidance when children use them.

                    <strong>ZERO-SUGAR DRINKS | 无糖饮料</strong>
                    <br/>In recent years, with the growth of consumer demand for health and weight control, the popularity of sugar-free drinks has also been rapidly increasing. However, sugar substitute  widely used in various types of zero-sugar drinks can pose the same risks of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases as sugary drinks. Theoretically, sweeteners produced in compliance with relevant standards are safe, so there is no need to worry excessively, but daily intake of sweets still needs to be controlled.

                    <strong>POSTURE CORRECTOR | 体态矫正神器</strong>
                    <br/>A product called "Cross-shaped Body Stick" claiming to be able to correct hunchback posture has become popular. Its principle is to pull the person out of a hunched position by external force, forcefully stretching the thoracic vertebrae, which actually violates the objective laws of the human body. If used improperly, it can actually cause damage to the body. It is better to take professional training to correct the posture.

                    <br/>There is no essential difference between infant water and regular drinking water. Boiling common water is enough for babies to drink. In addition, babies have a strong metabolism and excrete water faster than adults. Rather than focusing on what water to drink, parents should ensure that their babies drink plenty of water.

                    <br/>Good-quality children's study desks and chairs not only create a good learning environment, but also help children learn the correct writing posture. When parents choose them, they should pay attention to factors such as whether the corners of the table are rounded, whether there are easily crushed gaps between the table and chair, and whether the table has good fixation.

                    <br/>Due to their approaching expiration dates, some foods are sold at a discount, and such foods are becoming more and more popular. Through some comparative testing, it was found that there are some differences in quality between close-to-expiration date foods and fresh foods, but they are still within an acceptable range. However, people should avoid buying close-to-expiration date foods that contain high levels of vitamins and try to buy products with more recent production dates.

                    <strong>TEA BAGS | 茶叶袋</strong>
                    <br/>When making homemade tea bags, attention should be paid to whether the tea bags have production permit information. Regardless of whether they are made of paper or plastic, these products are flammable, and plastic materials are not resistant to high temperatures. Therefore, plastic tea bags cannot be heated in electrical appliances to avoid the tea bags melting due to high temperatures. In addition, most tea bags use non-water-soluble materials, so they cannot be directly thrown into the sewer after use, otherwise, it will cause blockages.
